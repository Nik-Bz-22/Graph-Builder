# Graphs and Algorithms

This project is an application for modeling graphs using Python and the `networkx` library, as well as applying various graph algorithms such as Maximum Spanning Tree, Minimum Spanning Tree, Randic Index, and graph Invariant Calculation.

The project allows creating multiple workspaces (tabs) for modeling different graphs, uploading an image as the background for each workspace, and saving and opening graphs.

## Project Description

The project allows creating and visualizing graphs using the `tkinter` library. It also implements various graph algorithms, including:

- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**
- **Prim's Algorithm**
- **Minimum Spanning Tree**
- **Maximum Spanning Tree**
- **Randic Index Calculation**
- **Graph Invariant Calculation**

Users can interact with the graph, add and remove nodes and edges, and run algorithms on the created graphs. The project also supports working with multiple workspaces, saving and opening graphs, and using images as the background for each workspace.

## Features

- **Create Graph**: Add nodes and edges to the canvas.
- **Delete Elements**: Remove nodes and edges.
- **Apply Algorithms**: Select an algorithm to find the shortest path or find the spanning tree.
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualize graphs using `tkinter` on the canvas.
- **Upload Image to Workspace**: Upload an image as the background for the graph.
- **Multiple Workspaces (Tabs)**: Create multiple tabs for working with different graphs.
- **Save and Open Graphs**: Save and open graphs from a file for further work.
- **Find Minimum and Maximum Spanning Tree**: Use Prim's or Kruskal's algorithm to find the minimum or maximum spanning tree.
- **Randic Index Calculation**: Calculate the Randic index for graph analysis.
- **Graph Invariant Calculation**: Calculate the graph invariant for further analysis.
